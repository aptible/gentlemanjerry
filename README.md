[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aptible/gentlemanjerry.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aptible/gentlemanjerry)

A log forwarder for Docker container logs which runs as a Docker container itself.

Gentleman Jerry is a Docker image that's a wrapper around [Logstash](https://logstash.net). Together with
[Joe Cool](https://github.com/aptible/joecool), it performs filtering and forwarding for logs
generated by Docker containers. The Gentleman Jerry image includes an output plugin for sending
syslog-formatted logs over TLS that works with common third-party log collectors like
[Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com).

A typical setup is a single Gentleman Jerry running for each log destination (an Elasticsearch instance,
a syslog drain, etc.) and multiple Joe Cools running for each class of service you're forwarding logs
from (a web service, a worker service, etc.). Many Joe Cools forward logs to on Gentleman Jerry, which
forwards the logs on to their final destination.

## Example

To run your own Gentleman Jerry, first create a key and self-signed certificate named
jerry.key/jerry.crt. Logstash and logstash-forwarder require either the certificate common
name to match the domain used to address GentlemanJerry or that the server IP is
specified as the Subject Alternative Name in the certificate. In the instructions that
follow, we'll assume the latter and describe the process for IP-based addressing.

First, make a `/tmp/jerry-cert` directory and create a config file named `/tmp/jerry-cert/jerry.config`
with the following contents (substituting the actual server IP for `$IP_ADDRESS` or using
the address of the `docker0` interface for `$IP_ADDRESS` if you're going to run everything locally).

```
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no
[req_distinguished_name]
CN = $IP_ADDRESS
[v3_req]
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer
basicConstraints = CA:TRUE
subjectAltName = IP:$IP_ADDRESS
```

Next, use that config file to generate the key and self-signed certificate:

```
$ openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -config /tmp/jerry-cert/jerry.config -keyout /tmp/jerry-cert/jerry.key -out /tmp/jerry-cert/jerry.crt
```

Pull the image from quay (`docker pull quay.io/aptible/gentlemanjerry`) or build it locally
(`make build`). The image name will be `quay.io/aptible/gentlemanjerry:latest` if you pull or build
from the `master` branch.

Finally, start a container running that image that mounts in the certificate and key and runs on a
port of your choice, say, 1234:

````
$ docker run -i -t -p 1234:5000 -v /tmp/jerry-cert:/tmp/certs quay.io/aptible/gentlemanjerry:latest
```

Alternatively, you can provide these via the `SSL_CERTIFICATE` and `SSL_KEY` environment variables.

You should see the message "Logstash startup completed" when it's up and running.

Now you're ready to [spawn a Joe Cool](https://github.com/aptible/joecool#Example) and send logs
to your instance.

## Environment variables

Runtime behavior of Gentleman Jerry can be modified by passing the following environment variables to
`docker run`:

* `LOGSTASH_OUTPUT_CONFIG`: A logstash output configuration. A
  [full list of supported outputs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/output-plugins.html)
  includes syslog, elasticsearch, files, and more. Gentleman Jerry includes the syslog output as
  well as many other common outputs that ship with Logstash. See `/logstash-1.5.0/Gemfile` in the
  Gentleman Jerry image to see a full list of available outputs. Default: `stdout { codec => rubydebug }`,
  which prints log messages to stdout for testing.
* `LOGSTASH_FILTERS`: Any additional logstash filter definitions. Example: to rename the `log`
  field to `message`, set this variable to "filter { mutate { rename => ['log', 'message'] } }".
  Default: empty string.
* `LOGSTASH_MAX_HEAP_SIZE`: Optional. Restricts the JVM max heap size for the logstash agent.
  Default is "64M". Gentleman Jerry will restart Logstash if/when it dies because of running out of heap.

### Sending syslog-formatted logs over TLS

To send logs from Gentleman Jerry to a syslog drain like [Papertrail](https://www.papertrailapp.com)
using a HOST:PORT endpoint, configure `LOGSTASH_OUTPUT_CONFIG` with the following string:

```
syslog {
  facility => "user-level"
  host => "HOST"
  port => PORT
  protocol => "tls-tcp"
  severity => "informational"
  appname => "%{service}"
}
```

and configure `LOGSTASH_FILTERS` with:

```
grok {
  keep_empty_captures => true
  overwrite => [ "message" ]
  match => [ "log", "%{GREEDYDATA:message}" ]
}
```


## Tests

All tests are implemented in bats. Run them with:

    make build

## Image building an release

On PR: All pushes to PR branches will have a PR number tag built and pushed to our image repos

On merge to Master: the "master" and "latest" tags will be built and pushed to our image repos

On release creation: the versioned release tag will be build and pushed to our image repos

To update drains, you must update the LogDrainBackend.gentlemanjerry_tag for the right object, and provision the drains.
